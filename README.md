# liveAutoLocation

This is made for our college. If each autoDriver have site open it will keep on sending data to server through which students and staff can be helped. 
This is made from scratch as it establishes simple linear regression analysis with coordinates of thapar's map image. So we can easily get where to mark location if provided with longitudes and latitudes.
